In contrast to the http_get request method where only a URL is sent to the server, http_post_string() also includes a string that is sent to the server and may result in the creation of a new resource or the update of an existing resource or both. It should be noted that HTTP request parameters (the bits sometimes \"tacked on\" to the end of a URL when you submit a form on a web page) are perfectly acceptable when using this function too.  This event will generate a \"call back\" which is picked up by any [HTTP Events](../../../2_interface/1_editors/events/async_events.html), in which case it will generate a [ds_map](../data_structures/ds%20maps/index.html) (more commonly known as a \"dictionary\") that is exclusive to this event and is stored in the special variable **async_load**. This ds_map will contain different values depending on whether there is data being returned or not. For example, if you have requested a file, the event will trigger multiple times as each packet of data is received so that you can show a progress bar, for example. The general structure for the ds_map will be as follows:       If there are multiple packets being returned to your game, the callback \"status\" key will return 1, in which case the ds_map will have the following additional keys:       **NOTE:** You should be aware that due to XSS protection in browsers, requests to and attempts to load resources from across domains are blocked and may appear to return blank results.

You can also set a fall-off distance (0 will make the sound silent, default is 100) which will make the sound fade out as it gets further from the listener position. How the fade itself is heard will depend on the falloff reference (which is the distance under which the volume for the source would normally drop by half) and the roll off factor (which affects the sound past the falloff reference distance only). The default factor is normally 1, and the effect of the different falloff values will depend on the model chosen (for a complete guide to the different falloff models and how these values are used, please see the function [audio_falloff_set_model](audio_falloff_set_model.html)).  The last two arguments are to set the sound is to loop or not and, finally, for assigning a priority to the sound.

Switching v-sync on may give a smoother gaming experience but it will also need more processing power and so its impact must be considered careful before use, and the same goes for the anti-aliasing where the higher the number the more processing that is required.  Since not all target devices are the same, some may not support 8x or 4x anti-aliasing for example, and so there is a **read only** variable available for getting the different levels of AA that the device running the game can display:  display_aa  This variable will return an integer value based on the setting of bits for the different levels.

Note that when using this function you must call [gif_save()](gif_save.html) to end the creation of the gif before open another file for recording (so for every gif_open() there must be an accompanying gif_save()).",

For example, it's possible that **(5 / 3) * 3** will *not* be equal to 5! To help avoid this, a precision value is used on all real number functions, and when the *difference between two numbers is smaller* than this precision they are considered equal.

Note that if you are drawing any of the assets and supplying an alpha argument as part of the function (for example, when using draw_sprite_ext()), then the alpha value set here will be overridden, so drawing a sprite using draw_sprite_ext with an alpha argument of 1 will draw the sprite fully opaque regardless of the alpha set with draw_set_alpha (this will work the same when using draw_self() and setting the image_alpha of the instance). Also note that when an instance is *default* drawing (ie: it has a sprite but no Draw Event), then the image_alpha variable will be clamped to the alpha set with draw_set_alpha(), such that an image_alpha of 1 and a draw alpha of 0.5 will draw the sprite at alpha 0.5, while an image_alpha of 0.25 and a draw alpha of 0.5 will draw the sprite at 0.25 alpha.",

If you set them to the same value the particles will all be created with the same orientation.  You can also set an increment value which will add (if a positive number) or subtract (if a negative number) an amount of degrees to the orientation over its lifetime. This value can be a minimum of (+/-) 0.01.  You can set the \"wiggle\" factor too, the same as other particle functions. This is a value that will be added or subtracted randomly to the orientation each step of the particles lifetime. Obviouslylarger values are more pronounced than smaller ones, and this value can even be a negative with the maximum range being between -20 and 20.  Finally, you can choose to have the orientation relative or not, which means that while the particle has a direction (and speed) the particle sprite will be orientated around that vector. Bear in mind that if you have the particle speed set to reduce and it reaches 0, the lack of speed sets the direction to the default value of 0° and so a relative orientation will cause the particle sprite to \"jump\" to a different angle.",

The same goes for the sub-image, as this can also be set to the instance variable [image_index](../../instances/instance_variables/image_index.html) which will set the sub-image to that selected for the current instance sprite (note, that you can draw a different sprite and still use the sub-image value for the current instance), or you can use any other value for this to draw a specific sub-image of the chosen sprite. If the value is larger than the number of sub-images, then *GameMaker Studio 2* will automatically loop the number to select the corresponding image (for example, if the sprite being drawn has 5 sub-images numbered 0 to 4 and we set the index value to 7, then the function will draw sub-image 3, numbered 0).

You can use the function [tilemap_get](../../rooms/tilemaps/tilemap_get.html) to get the tile data which can then be manipulated using the [Tile Functions](../../rooms/tilemaps/index.html#tiles), or you can construct it yourself using the following tile constants along with the index value of the tile to create:        You would bitwise \"or\" these constants with the tile index value to get the final tiledata:  var tiledata = 8 | tile_rotate | tile_flip;   The above code simply creates a local variable to store the tiledata for the tile with the index of 8 on the tile set, and it is rotated and flipped. This can then be used to draw the tile at that index from the tile set that you specify. this is not linked to any tilemap layer and the tile will be drawn at the layer depth of the instance doing the drawing, at the x/y position that you specify in the room. Note that you can also set the frame to draw too. If the indexed tile is part of an animation set, then you can set the frame number here (from 0 to the number of frames - 1) and the indexed tile will simply be the indicator for which animated tile set you are using while it will be the given frame that is drawn.

So, you would have your \"main\" canvas, and then your secondary surface canvas elements, which will be assigned using this function to the correct surfaces. The following image is an example of how a page with three canvas elements would be set up:   The page layout can be tricky, especially if you wish all the elements to line up correctly, but once the hard task of creating the layout has been completed, you can then add this html file as the default page file for the game using the [ HTML5 Tab](../../../../2_interface/3_settings/game_options/options_html5.html) of the [Game Options](../../../../2_interface/3_settings/game_options/index.html). The next thing you should do is set up your room and views, as each surface will need to be associated with a specific view to \"capture\" the game images (see the view variable [view_surface_id[0...7]](../../cameras%20and%20display/cameras/view_surface_id.html)).

Normally all surfaces have depth buffers so if you draw 3D objects to them then it'll sort them properly by depth in order to maintain functional parity between rendering to surfaces and rendering to the back buffer, however allocating depth buffers essentially doubles the amount of memory required for surfaces, which could be an excessive and unnecessary overhead especially if your game is very memory intensive, and for 2D games they aren't generally required.  To use this function you would call it *before* creating a surface, and then you can enable it again after (if required). All surfaces created when the depth buffer is disabled will no longer use a depth buffer when being drawn to, this results in the things being drawn to the surface having parity of depth. The images below illustrate this in practice:   In the above image, we are drawing a rectangle and a triangle using a vertex buffer in 3D. The coordinates for the red triangle places it behind the green rectangle, but the code for drawing the triangle is called *after* the code for the rectangle, and when the depth buffer is enabled, the triangle is still drawn behind the rectangle as the 3D depth is being respected. However when we disable the depth buffer for the surface, only the code order is respected and so the triangle is drawn over the rectangle.  **NOTE**: To properly preserve depth in 3D when using surfaces, not only should you have the depth buffer enabled, but you should also have z-writing and z-testing enabled. See the functions [gpu_set_ztestenable()](../gpu/gpu_set_ztestenable.html) and [gpu_set_zwriteenable()](../gpu/gpu_set_zwriteenable.html) for more information.  **NOTE**: If your game is 100% 2D or you know that you don't need a surface depth buffer, then it should be fine to simply call this function once at the start of the game to disable the buffer.",

You can define the size of the font (in points), as well as whether the font should be **bold** or *italic*, and you can also define the range of characters to include (for a full table of available characters and their UTF8 value see [Font tables](font_tables.html)). The function returns an *index* value that should be stored in a variable as this will be needed in all further codes that refer to this font.   For the HTML5 target module, this function **can only be used to add **, and will only work if WebGL is **not** enabled - if WebGL is enabled then you must use a general font resource (ie: using [draw_set_font](../drawing/text/draw_set_font.html) along with a font from the resource tree) or bitmap fonts (see [font_add_sprite](font_add_sprite.html)).  **IMPORTANT!** When targeting HTML5, italics and bold text is only supported if the font asset or web font itself has these characters included. They will not be synthesised from the base font.   The following table shows the fonts that are standard across all browsers and that should be be available for use without problems. Any other font may or may not exist on the computer or device that is running your game, so the use of this function should be limited to these standard fonts:         On all other (non Web) targets, you can use this function to add a font from a file. The file **must be included in the game bundle** using the [Included Files](../../../2_interface/1_editors/included_files.html) functionality of *GameMaker Studio 2*, and must be a *.ttf format font file, useful for adding non-standard fonts like Asian or Arabic.  **WARNING!:** If you include a font in *.ttf format with a game, it **must be licensed** for distribution with the game.   When loading a font from a file in this way the *size* of the font is in **pixels** and the *first* and *last* values are ignored, meaning all glyphs in the font will be added. Fonts added in this way are assigned to their own texture page, so care should be taken when using this function as it will increment the number of texture swaps when drawing. It is also worth noting that fonts may appear slightly larger when drawn, since glyphs may have parts that are drawn outside of the bounding box defined for the font. You should be aware too that there is a limitation of around 200 glyphs that can be rendered in a single frame for a particular font.  **NOTE:** When you load a font into *GameMaker Studio 2*: Studio you must remember to remove it again (with [font_delete](font_delete.html)) when no longer needed, otherwise there is risk of a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game.",

The created sprite font will then have the sub-images set to an individual glyph from the font, where the \"first\" glyph will have the image_index of 0. You can define \"space\" as being any character you want, for example a single line the size that you want the space to be, and all spaces in text will be rendered at that width (but the image chosen will *never* be rendered), or if you don't supply a sprite for space then the width of the widest character in the sprite font will be used instead.  You can also set the spacing for the font to be proportional (true) or not (false), where a proportional font is spaced based on the actual width of the letters (so the letter \"i\" takes less room than the letter \"w\", for example) while a non-proportional font will be spaced based on the sub-image width, like a monospaced font. Finally, you can define the space to leave between each letter when writing, and this can be any integer value, with 0 being no space (the letters will \"touch\" if proportional). The function returns an *index* value that should be stored in a variable as this will be needed in all further codes that refer to this font.  It is also worth noting that there cannot be any *spaces* in the character map, so that if you, for example, use '.' and '0' but not '/', you need to either include '/' anyway or leave a blank sub-image between the two used characters.  The sprite itself can be a sprite asset from the resource tree or one loaded from a file using sprite_add first to get the index of the loaded sprite (which is then used in the function). For further details of the character map to use when making sprite fonts, please see the page on [Font Tables](font_tables.html). It's important to note that for the font alignment functions (like [draw_set_halign()](../drawing/text/draw_set_halign.html)) to work as expected when using a sprite font, the sprite should have its origin set to the *top left corner*. If you use other values then you will need to take the origin offset into consideration when drawing text using the font.  **NOTE:** When you load a font into *GameMaker Studio 2* you must remember to remove it again (with [font_delete](font_delete.html)) when no longer needed, otherwise there is risk of a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game.",

In this way, you can have (for example) a bomb change into an explosion - in which case the \"perf\" argument would probably be true as you would want the bomb to perform its Destroy Event and Clean Up Event, as well as the explosion to perform its Create Event - or you could have your player character change into a different one - in which case the \"perf\" argument would probably be false as you do not want the instances to perform their Create and Destroy/Clean Up events.  It is worth noting that changing the instance means that you should perform no further actions with that instance until the next step, in particular trying to access variables etc... as that will cause an error. Basically, you change the instance but it is not actually available until the end of the current step, so to access any of the variables it contains directly (for example, calling obj_Changed.x) will not work.  **WARNING!** When changing a physics enabled instance, the physical properties **will not be carried over** to the new instance being changed into. Therefore you should have code in place to \"transfer\" the physics state of the current instance over to the new instance, or have defined the new instances physical properties in its Create Event, or in the object editor. For this reason it is recommended that you not use this function with physics enabled instances, but rather use a combination of instance_destroy() and instance_create_layer().",

Calling the function with no arguments will simply destroy the instance that is currently in scope and running the code, but you can provide an optional \"id\" argument and target a specific instance by using the instance ID value, or you can target all instances of a particular object by using an object_index. For example:  instance_destroy(other); // destroy the other instance in a Collision Event instance_destroy(obj_Bullet); // destroy ALL instances of the object \"obj_Bullet\"  The second *optional* flag permits you to \"switch off\" the Destroy Event for the instance being destroyed. By default the Destroy Event will *always* be performed, but if you set this flag to false then you can make the instance destroy itself and skip performing that event.  **IMPORTANT!** This will skip the Destroy Event, but the Clean Up event will still be called.   It is worth noting that when you destroy an instance, its destroy event is called *immediately* after the code or action that calls the destroy. Second, although the destroy event is performed, the instance *is not immediately removed from the game*, and it will continue to perform the code contained in the current event. Only when the current event is over will it be removed from the game.  So, if you have, for example, this code:  f hp <= 0 instance_destroy(); score += 10;  The variable \"score\" will be incremented *even though the *, and the instance will finally be removed from your game at the end of the event. Be careful of this, as if you have (for example) created a dynamic resource for the instance, like a data structure, and then have destroyed that resource in the destroy event, if there are any references to it after the destroy function or action has been performed then you will get an \"unknown resource\" error, as the destroy event removed it from the game.",

This type of rounding is called *bankers rounding* and over large numbers of iterations or when using floating point maths, it gives a statistically better rounding than the more traditional \"round up if over .5 and round down otherwise\" approach.  What this means is that if the fraction of a value is 0.5, then the rounded result is the *even integer* nearest to the input value. So, for example, 23.5 becomes 24, as does 24.5, while -23.5 becomes -24, as does -24.5.

The actual mathematical formula can be written like this:   So, in 2D the dot product of vectors a[x1,y1] and b[x2,2] is x1x2 + y1y2, meaning that the dot_product in *GameMaker Studio 2* is calculated as:  a · b = (x1*x2)+(y1*y2);  The curious thing about the dot product is the relationship it has to the angle formed by the input vectors which can be expressed as:  a · b = (length of a) * (length of b) * cos(angle)  That is to say, the dot product of two vectors will be equal to the cosine of the angle between those vectors, multiplied by the lengths of each of them. Here is an image to illustrate:   There are a few things that we can now state from any two vectors in relation to the result of their dot product:   If a and b are perpendicular (at 90 degrees to each other), the result of the dot product will be zero, because cos(ang) will be zero  If the angle between a and b are less than 90 degrees, the dot product will be positive (greater than zero), as cos(ang) will be positive  If the angle between a and b are greater than 90 degrees, the dot product will be negative (less than zero), as cos(ang) will be negative   So what does this mean for those of us that make games? Well, this mathematical relationship can be used in quite a few circumstances, but the best way to see it is to build an actual scenario and see for yourself what is going on. One of the simplest ways to do this is to generate a simple \"line of sight\" check for an enemy in, say, a platform game so that the enemy will \"see\" the player if they are within 90° of either side of their vector *normal*.   Basically, we have to get the vector normal from the enemy (ie: comprised of a direction and sight distance) and then we need to get the vector of the player to the enemy.

Please note that this means that should you do something in your game code that is incorrect, the compiled game *may simply crash*, or it may experience some *very unexpected behaviour*. For example, if a ds_grid is accessed at a coordinate outside of the defined size, in developer mode you would get a compiler window error message but the checks in place would permit the game to continue running. However in release mode these checks will not be there and so the code could return either a NULL pointer, or a bad pointer which in turn will point to some random memory. So at best you could get the wrong data returned, or at worst you could overwrite something in memory - data, graphics, or even code itself. Another example would be when building primitives - if you supply the colour, position, texture, etc... data in a different order to that which you defined when you created the vertex format, then the game may crash or produce unexpected results when release mode is on.",

If you are using this function on Windows, Ubuntu (Linux), MacOS or HTML5 platforms, then the function is only toggled for **one step** to true when the game loses focus, and then it will return false again until the game is returned to focus (and loses it again).

In the image you can see that an instance at the position 260,130 falls on the grid cell 8,4. You can calculate mathematically the exact cell that a position lands on easily by either dividing the number by the grid resolution and then rounding down *or* (if you are using power of 2 grid resolutions like 8, 16, 32 etc...) you can use the bitwise operators.

This image illustrates this behaviour:   The two instances above have been added into the mp_grid using the mp_grid_add_instances function with precise being set as true. As you can see the, green instance has only marked the grid squares it \"touches\" as forbidden, due to the fact that its sprite mask is also set to precise.

This is because the sprite mask is **not** set to precise, meaning that even if you are using the precise setting in the function, only the bounding box of the sprite will be considered.

You can also select either horizontal/vertical movement only, or allow full diagonal movements by specifying true in the allowdiag argument. The function returns either true (it succeeded in finding a path) or false (it failed) as well as setting the chosen path. In the following image, you can see how this all works together:   As you can see, the \"pipe\" objects have been added into the grid, meaning that any path created has to go around them. There are two paths created in the image, one (green) has been made with diagonals allowed and the other (red) without. The difference between the two is pretty obvious with the green path appearing much more \"elegant\" and direct, but it all depends what use you are going to put them to which one you prefer. Note that the path is independent of the current instance - it is a path through the grid, not a path for a specific instance, even though a specific instance may have the variable that stores the path index. You may also need to debug these paths to see how they are made and interact within the game environment, in which case you should be using the [draw_path](../../drawing/forms/draw_path.html) function.  **NOTE**: The path must have been previously created (either in code with [path_add](../../paths/changing%20paths/path_add.html) or as a resource) and will be replaced by the path generated by this function.",

            "documentation": "The mp_potential_ functions do their work using a number of parameters that can be changed using this function. Globally the method works as follows: it first tries to move straight towards the goal, looking a number of steps ahead which can be set with the parameter \"ahead\" (default value is 3). Reducing this value means that the instance will start changing direction later as it doesn't \"see\" as far ahead, and increasing it means it will start changing direction earlier. If this check leads to a collision then it starts looking at directions more to the left and to the right of the ideal, straight-line direction. It does this in steps of size \"rotstep\" (default value is 10), and reducing this gives the instance more movement possibilities but will be slower as it needs more processing power.  The parameter \"maxrot\" is a bit more difficult to explain! The instance has a current direction of movement, and maxrot (default value is 30) indicates how much it is allowed to vary its direction either side of that current direction in one step. So even if it can move e.g. straight to the goal it will only do so if it does not violate this maximal change of direction. If you make maxrot a large value then the instance can change direction a lot in each step, and this will make it easier to find a short path but the path will be uglier and less natural. If you make the value smaller then the path will be smoother but it might take longer detours (and sometimes even fail to find the goal). Finally, When no step can be made the behavior depends on the value of the parameter \"onspot\". If onspot is true (the default value), then the instance will rotate on its spot by the amount indicated with \"maxrot\" and if it is false it will not move at all. Setting it to false is useful for e.g. cars but reduces the chance of the instance finding a path.",

These configurations are given as **constants** and the setting will depend on the constant that you have chosen. The table below lists the available constants and their settings:         The first option (network_config_connect_timeout) simply sets the timeout for connecting to a server but doesn't change connection behaviour apart from the time you have to wait. It is recommended that you don't set this too low and keep it at about 1000 for a LAN only game or 4000 or so for internet, or the game may fail to connect randomly. If you wish to set a timeout value for sending/receiving packets then use the function [network_set_timeout()](network_set_timeout.html).  The second option (network_config_use_non_blocking_socket) means that the network connect functions will all return a socket_id instantly, *but you can't send or receive on that socket until you've received an async network event*. The event triggered will have the \"type\" key set to network_type_non_blocking_connect (you can find further details from the page on the [Networking Asynchronous Event](../../../2_interface/1_editors/events/async_events.html)). This is a **global** setting as *GameMaker Studio 2* does not support a mixture of blocking and non-blocking in one application.  The third and fourth options (network_config_enable_reliable_udp, network_config_disable_reliable_udp) are for enabling or disabling the *GameMaker Studio 2* reliable UDP protocol and as such, should **only be used with UDP connections**. What \"reliable\" in this case this means is that, when enabled on *both* ends of a connection, *GameMaker Studio 2* will attempt to check your packets have arrived correctly and re-send any that don't arrive (note, we do not guarantee in your packets will arrive in order of transmission). When using a reliable socket type, there will be a 12-byte header added to all udp packets which contains information needed by *GameMaker Studio 2* to check the packet for errors and re-send missing packets. The following points are worth noting when using this option:   The protocol should be enabled/disabled on both sides before sending your data, and any data sent or received before the option has been enabled/disabled will not be affected.    You can enable or disable the protocol for any given socket ID multiple times, as long as this is properly managed on both the server side and client side    It is possible to have two separate UDP sockets, one with reliable UDP enabled for one with reliable UDP disabled for the other.      **NOTE**: This function will not work when used in a project running on the HTML5 target.",

Finally, if a persisted instance moves to a room with a layer at the same depth as the instance was created on, it will *not* be assigned to this layer, but instead a new layer will be created at the same depth (following the naming convention explained previously).

You should note too that you must also have at least **three** points defined for your polygon before binding it to an instance or you will get an error and that adding a point to a fixture that does not have a polygon shape set previously will also cause an error. Note too that the maximum number of points permitted for a fixture is **eight**.  For chain shapes (which are simply a series connected edge shapes) this function will set a point as a \"connection\" to chain the edges together at. Therefore you need to have defined at least two points before binding the fixture to the instance otherwise you will get an error. However, unlike for polygons, you are not limited to a maximum of eight points and can add as many as you require to create the chain and the points are defined in actual room coordinates, rather than relative to the instance.",

This will have a direct impact on how much inertia a fixture has as well as how it reacts to collisions and forces, so if you make a small shape with a high density it will have a very large mass (like a bar of lead), but if you define a large shape with a low density it will have a much smaller mass (like a balloon).  **NOTE**: If you wish the instance that is going to receive the fixture to be static (ie: immobile in the game world) then the density should be set to 0, essentially giving it an infinite density.",

The exact force is defined by the vector we get from the components xforce/yforce in relation to the xpos/ypos coordinates - which simply means that the force is calculated as the distance from xpos/ypos to xforce/yforce in Newtons (a Newton being defined as the amount of net force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at a rate of one meter per second squared)and the direction is the angle that we get from xpos/ypos to xforce/yforce.

The exact force is defined by the vector we get from the components xforce/yforce in relation to those coordinates - which simply means that the force is calculated as the distance from xlocal/ylocal to xforce/yforce in Newtons, and the direction is the angle that we get from xlocal/ylocal to xforce/yforce.

You should also realise that the joints are created independently of the size of the sprite of the instances or the fixtures they have attached. So, if you create a distance joint somewhere other than the origin of the instance, it is still valid and will constrain the two instances relative to the position at which it was created.

In principle you can create gears in *GameMaker Studio 2* by using compounding instances to model gear teeth, but this is not very efficient and might be tedious to author! Thankfully there is a simpler method, and that is to use a *gear joint*. To make one you need to have previously defined your fixtures and created the two basic joints that are going to comprise your gear - these **must** be made up of one [revolute joint](physics_joint_revolute_create.html) and either a [prismatic joint](physics_joint_prismatic_create.html) or another *revolute joint*. The image below shows how a gear would typically be created in a game:     So what happens? Well, once the two joints are added into the gear, interaction with one will have an effect on the other, so in the example image above, if you rotate inst2, inst3 will move up and down, or if you move inst3 up and down then inst2 will rotate. You can also change the gear ratio, meaning that you need to move one instance more (or less) to get the desired effect. The code in the example at the bottom shows how something like the image above can be created.  **NOTE**: If you need to delete either of the two instances that are involved in the gear joint (or just delete their joints) then you **must** delete the gear joint first using [physics_joint_delete()](physics_joint_delete.html) or else you will get an error!",

This joint can then *only* move relative to this axis, like a spring or a piston. If you set the lower or upper trans limit, you are basically limiting the amount of movement along this axis, where the 0 position is the exact spot that you defined with w_anchor x/y, so a negative value would go to the \"left\" of that point along the axis and a positive value to the \"right\" as shown in the following diagram (realise that \"left\" and \"right\" are relative terms!):     You can also define the joint as having a motor or not. This means that when un-influenced by a collision the joint will move in a direction along the axis. this direction is defined by the motor speed, with a positive number being towards the axis coordinates (\"right\") and a negative number being towards the anchor point (\"left\"). The \"max_motor_force\" argument is for limiting the speed of the movement so that you don't get a perpetually accelerating motor and to limit the influence that a collision may have on the movement. In this way you can use a joint motor to simulate joint friction by setting the joint speed to zero and maximum force to some small, but significant value. The motor will try to prevent the joint from moving, but will yield to a significant load.  As with all the joints, if you set the \"col\" value to true then the two instances can interact and collide with each other but *only* if they have collision events, however if it is set to false, they will not collide no matter what.",

The following image illustrates this:     If you look at inst2 you can see that its local anchor point has been offset 20 pixels to the \"left\" of its origin (Remember! The world anchor points are defined using the room coordinates, while the local anchor points are defined relative to the origin of the instance). You can also specify a ratio for the pulley joint, which tells one side or the other to move faster, with a value below 1 making the first instance move faster (E.G. 0.5 will make it move twice as fast) and a value above 1 making the second instance move faster (E.G. 2 will make it move twice as fast).

            "documentation": "A revolute joint forces two bodies to share a common anchor point (often called a hinge point) and the joint has a single degree of freedom - the relative rotation of the two bodies around this point. To specify a revolute you need to provide two instances and a single anchor point in the room, as you can see in the image provided:     If you look at the image, you can see that the two instances have been created to over-lap and at the point where they are touching, we have defined a revolute joint. Now, this joint can be limited in its freedom of rotation thanks to the \"ang_min_limit\" and \"ang_max_limit\" values. How does this work? Well, let's look at another image:     As you can see, angles in the physics world are *not* the same as the standard *GameMaker Studio 2* angles where right is 0 degrees and then it goes anti-clockwise so that up is 90, left is 180, and down is 270. No, when dealing with the revolute joint, the 0 degrees axis runs from the joint position to the origin of the second instance defined by the function and the angles are then calculated in a clockwise direction. If you switch on angle limiting, the limits are defined as being relative to this 0 degree axis and the limit range *should include zero*, otherwise the joint will lurch when the room begins. Finally, you can define the joint as having a motor or not. This means that when uninfluenced by a collision the joint will move in a direction, which is defined by the motor speed with a positive number being clockwise and a negative number being anti-clockwise. The \"max_motor_torque\" argument is for limiting the speed of the rotation so that you don't get a perpetually accelerating motor and to limit the influence that a collision may have on the rotation. In this way you can use a joint motor to simulate joint friction by setting joint speed to zero and maximum torque to some small, but significant value. The motor will try to prevent the joint from rotating, but will yield to a significant load.  As with all the joints, if you set the \"col\" value to true then the two instances can interact and collide with each other but *only* if they have collision events, however if it is set to false, they will not collide no matter what.",

When you create a rope joint the two instances should already be created and have a fixture assigned, then you define the two anchor points in room coordinates. The first anchor point is connected to instance 1, the second anchor point is connected to instance 2 and the distance and the maxlength argument sets the maximum length constraint on the joint. The image below shows how this works:     As you can see, the anchor points are specified as room coordinates so care must be taken when defining them, especially if the instances are being created at the same time as the joints rather than being placed in the room through the room editor. You should also realise that the joints are created independently of the size of the sprite of the instances or the fixtures they have attached.

The weld joint will permit flexing between the two joined fixtures but without the stretching associated with, for example, a distance joint, and will always try to \"spring\" back to the reference angle when put under any stress or load. You define the point in the room where the joint should be created, as well as the angle that you wish the joint to try and maintain at all times, as shown in the image below:     As you can see, the anchor points are specified as room coordinates so care must be taken when defining them, especially if the instances are being created at the same time as the joints rather than being placed in the room through the room editor. You should also realise that the joints are created independently of the size of the sprite of the instances or the fixtures they have attached. So, if you create a weld joint somewhere other than the origin of the instance, it is still valid and will constrain the two instances relative to the position at which it was created.  Since the weld joint is flexible and will bend and flex when under any stress, you can set the oscillation frequency (in Hz) as well as the damping ratio for the joint to get different effects - you may need to play with these values to fine tune them and it is recommended that you start off with smaller values and increment them until you get the effect that you desire.

            "documentation": "This function can be used to set custom mass and inertia values for a physics enabled instance. Normally the mass, center of mass, and inertia for an instance is calculated using a combination the surface area of the bound fixtures and their density. However in very special occasions you may need to offset the center of mass or change the inertia and that is when you would use this function. Bear in mind that the mass is calculated in real world weight (ie:kilograms) and you should always try and keep values realistic for what you are modelling. So if your physics object is meant to represent a person, their mass would be approximately 70 kilos.  The center of mass is calculated automatically for you based on the shape of the fixture (or fixtures) you have defined. To get a general idea of where this could be, if you have a sprite that is the same shape as the fixtures you wish to create, then select the \"center origin\" option you will see approximately where the center of mass will be too. However, this may not be correct or you may be looking for a specific effect from your physics object, in which case this function can also be used to change the x and y coordinates for the center of mass. These are **local** values, so 0,0 is the point at which the fixtures are bound to the instance (the origin of the instance). So a center of mass of -4,0 would shift the center of mass to the left of the origin.  As for the inertia, this basically defines how resistant the instance is to changes in its direction and velocity, so a higher inertia makes it more resistant and a low inertia makes it less resistant (inertia and mass cannot be negative values!).  **NOTE**: This function does not set mass and inertia for individual fixtures, but rather for the whole physics enabled instance, no matter how many fixtures are bound to it.  **NOTE**: This function should only be used when necessary as the physics simulation is designed for the mass and inertia to be optimal based on the density and size of the fixture. Changing these values can have unforeseen effects.",

For example, if you want to simulate a viscous liquid with surface tension you would use the bitwise *or* \"|\" to flag the appropriate bits as shown in the example below. In this way you can set different properties (other than the global properties) for each individual particle created.  Other than the flags, you can also set the position in the room to create the particle at, the initial horizontal and vertical velocity, the initial colour and alpha, as well as the user **category**. The colour and alpha values are only used when drawing the particle using the function [physics_particle_draw()](physics_particle_draw.html), but the category value is used in multiple other functions. This value is an arbitrary integer value that you give each particle that you want to have similar properties, and it can be used to set flags later for that specific category as well as a number of other things. For example, if you have defined a \"water\" and an \"oil\" particle, you would give all those particles flagged as \"water\" the user category of 1 and all those particles created as \"oil\" the user category of 2, permitting you to later target a single category to change it's flags or get specific data.  **NOTE**: You can use any integer value for the category **except 0** which is reserved by the simulation and is used to select all categories in other functions (like for drawing).

A group of particles is one where the particles necessary to create a specific form are created all at once as a group, permitting you to create simulated soft-bodies with various properties set by the flags used. The \"flags\" are the return value of a combination of the **particle constants** (see the function [physics_particle_create](physics_particle_create.html) for details of these), while the \"groupFlags\" are a combination of the following **group constants** (or 0 for no flags):       These group flags use bit-masking to create a final output value that is then checked to set the different basic properties of the group, apart from those set by the particle flags. You can use none, one or both of these constants by using the bitwise *or* \"|\" to mask the appropriate bits (as shown in the example below).  Other than the flags, you can also set the position in the room to create the particle group at (the position given will be the center of mass of the finished group), the initial horizontal and vertical velocity, as well as the angular velocity of the group, permitting you to create moving, rotating groups.  You can also set initial colour and alpha of all particles in the group, with the values being used when drawing the particles using the function [physics_particle_draw()](physics_particle_draw.html). After that you set the cohesive strength of particles in the group, which is another way of saying how stongly they \"stick\" to each other. The strength can be a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is no cohesion, and 1 is maximum cohesion.  Finally you have to give the category for your particle group. This value is an arbitrary integer value that you give each particle group that you want to have similar properties, and it can be used to set flags later for that specific category as well as a number of other things.  **NOTE**: You can use any integer value for the category **except 0** which is reserved by the simulation and is used to select all categories in other functions (like for drawing).  It is important to note that calling this function does *not* create the group in the physics room. This function simply begins the process and sets the base particle properties for the group. To actually create the particle group you need to give it a *form* (see the example below) and then call the function [physics_particle_group_end()](physics_particle_group_end.html), at which point it will be created.  **NOTE**: The particle type flags that you set will also influence the cohesion of the particle group, such that if you flag the particles as being of the water type (for example), when the group collides with another fixture it will break apart, while if you flag the particle as a spring type, then it will maintain its cohesion on collision.",

Here are some images to illustrate...     As you can see, the xg,yg coordinates are relative to the position of 0,0 as defined for the physics world, and the gravity itself is calculated as a vector of those two components. So, the default values of 0,10 will give you a gravity direction of down (270 degrees) with an acceleration of 10 metres per second squared. Note the *metres per second squared*! Like all the physics functions, gravity is calculated using metres as a base measurement so the pixel to metre scale that you set in physics_world_create function is important here. Gravity is also *cumulative* on the object (but the exact amount depends on what you have set for the function [physics_fixture_set_linear_damping](../fixtures/physics_fixture_set_linear_damping.html)), meaning that in a room with a room_speed of 60, with no damping, the instance will accelerate by 10 metres per second, every second - which, if you have a 0.1 pixel to metre scale is the same as saying it will accelerate to a speed of 100 pixels per second in 60 steps.",

To that end we use the function physics_world_update_speed which sets the update speed for the physics system *independently* of the room speed.

If the IDE has set the animation speed for the sprite used to be calculated as Frames Per Game Frame, then the speed value given is a *multiplier*, with 1 being the default value, and setting it to 0.5 will half the animation speed, while setting it to 2 will double it.

The following image shows a schematic of how depth works for layers:   It is worth noting that while you *can* assign more than one layer to a single depth, *there is no way that you can guarantee that layers on the same depth will be drawn in any given order* and as such it is best to assign only one layer to any given depth.

The idea is that if you have, for example, pretty small tilesets of 16 x 16 tiles will have a total of 256 different tiles in each tile set, which only uses up 8 bits of your index in the tile data \"blob\" (from an available 19 bits of data). These bits can be \"masked\" and then the rest of the tile data can be used to store additional values.  An easy way to get the initial index mask value is to take the number of tiles in the tile set and subtract 1, so a 16x16 tile set has 256 tiles and a mask value of 255 (or $ff in hexadecimal), and if the tile set has a number of tiles that are *not* a power of two, then round up to the nearest power of two to get the mask, for example a tile set that is 20x20 has 400 tiles, which you would round up to 512, and so get a mask index value of 511 ($1ff in hexadecimal). Apart from the index mask, normally you would want to preserve the flip, rotate and mirror values that are assigned to a tile too, so to help with that there are a few **constants** that can be used. These can be \"or\"-ed together with the index mask value to preserve those bits of data. The following constants can be used (see the example code below for usage):        Tilemap bit masking is an advanced feature and allows you to use bits of the tile data \"blob\" for your own use. For example, the user could reserve a bit to mean \"solid\" in the tiledata structure and then this can be checked for fast collisions. Basically, the bit mask is \"and\"-ed against the tile data when the tilemap is *drawn* (so it doesn't affect any of the other functionality), meaning that bits which aren't in the mask are ignored, but can still be read and written to by the user for their own purposes. Note that there are two different masks â€“ a global one and one per tilemap - and these are \"and\"-ed together internally by *GameMaker Studio 2* before being used for drawing.",

The idea is that if you have, for example, a pretty small tile set of 16 x 16 tiles then you have a total of 256 different tiles in your tile set, which only uses up 8 bits of your index in the tile data \"blob\" (from an available 19 bits of data). These bits can be \"masked\" and then the rest of the tile data can be used to store additional values.  An easy way to get the initial index mask value is to take the number of tiles in the tile set and subtract 1, so a 16x16 tile set has 256 tiles and a mask value of 255 (or $ff in hexadecimal), and if the tile set has a number of tiles that are not a power of two, then round up to the nearest power of two to get the mask, for example a tile set that is 20x20 has 400 tiles, which you would round up to 512, and so get a mask index value of 511 ($1ff in hexadecimal). Apart from the index mask, normally you would want to preserve the flip, rotate and mirror values that are assigned to a tile too, so to help with that there are a few **constants** that can be used. These can be \"or\"-ed together with the index mask value to preserve those bits of data. The following constants can be used (see the example code below for usage):        Tilemap bit masking is an advanced feature and allows you to use bits of the tile data \"blob\" for your own use. For example, the user could reserve a bit to mean \"solid\" in the tiledata structure and then this can be checked for fast collisions. Basically, the bit mask is \"and\"-ed against the tile data when the tilemap is *drawn* (so it doesn't affect any of the other functionality), meaning that bits which aren't in the mask are ignored, but can still be read and written to by the user for their own purposes. Note that there are two different masks â€“ a global one and one per tilemap - and these are \"and\"-ed together internally by *GameMaker Studio 2* before being used for drawing.",

You must previously have gotten the \"handle\" of the constant using the function [shader_get_uniform](shader_get_uniform.html), and you will have to know what type of constant it is to pass the correct number of floating point values through to it, ie: if you have a vec2 you will need to pass two values to the function.  An exception to the above rule is when dealing with 32bit colour values. You can pass into the shader up to eight 32bit colour values and they will automatically be converted for you into vec4 values of 0 - 1. However for this you *must* use the shader constant name in_Colour, for a single colour, or in_Colour0, in_Colour1, etc... up to in_Colour7 for multiple input values. The following to examples show how this would look in the shader itself:      //Single colour     attribute vec2 in_Position;     attribute vec4 in_Colour;     attribute vec2 in_TextureCoord;      //Multiple colours     attribute vec2 in_Position;     attribute vec4 in_Colour0;     attribute vec4 in_Colour1;     attribute vec2 in_TextureCoord;  Note too that if you want to do compressed normals etc... using a 4 byte colour format, then you will also have to use the same \"in_Colour\" format as shown above too.  **NOTE**: All uniforms must be set **after** calling the function [shader_set()](shader_set.html), and before calling [shader_reset](shader_reset.html).",

            "documentation": "With this function you can add an image as a sprite, loading it from an external source where the image file to be loaded should **always** be in either *.png, *.gif, *.jpg/jpeg or *.json format (*json files are used for loading [skeleton animation sprites](skeletal%20animations/index.html) made with Spine). The function returns the new sprite index which must then be used in all further codes that relate to the sprite. If you use this function with HTML5 or are getting an image from an URL, this function will also generate an **Image Loaded** asynchronous event. See [The Asynchronous Event](../../../2_interface/1_editors/events/async_events.html) page for more information.  All images that are to be turned into animated sprites - except for *.gif (see below) - should have a \"strip\" format (see the image below) and it will be split into the number of sub-images specified following the rule **sprite width = strip width / sub images**.   As you can see in the above image, the sprite has been placed on a dark purple background, and this can be removed by setting the \"removeback\" argument to true. This works by checking the *bottom left* pixel of the sprite for the colour there and then uses that as the colour to be removed. For example, in the above image, if we had the bottom left pixel colour as green, all the green parts of the sprite would have been removed and the rest of the purple background ignored.  If you choose the \"removeback\" option, you may also want *GameMaker Studio 2* to smooth the edges of the sprite by setting the \"smooth\" argument to true. All this does is create a semi-transparent border around the edges of the sprite after it has had its background removed.  Finally you can also specify the x and y *origin* for the sprite. This is the point where the sprite is \"fixed\" onto the instance that uses it, and is always calculated as relative to the 0,0 top left corner of one sprite sub-image. So, for example, a sprite that is 32 x 32 pixels with these values set to (16,16) will have its origin in the center.  If you are adding a *.gif format image, then you only need to specify the filename and image number (which should be 1 for the first frame) and can leave all the other arguments as 0, noting that **only the first image of the GIF will be loaded**. For *.json sprites, the image number should be 1, and the \"removeback\" and \"smooth\" settings will be ignored.  By default all new sprites have their bounding boxes calculated automatically (the exact bounding box will depend on the size and transparency of the sprite), however you may wish to customise this, in which case you should also use the function [sprite_collision_mask](sprite_collision_mask.html).  It should be noted that the memory used when adding a sprite in this way will be larger than you may expect. This is because *GameMaker Studio 2* will store the sprite as a texture page *and* it will also be stored in GPU memory, so the total memory will be larger than would be expected for an image file of the same sprite.  **NOTE:** When you load a sprite into *GameMaker Studio 2* you must remember to remove it again (with [sprite_delete](sprite_delete.html)) when no longer needed, otherwise there is risk of a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game.  **NOTE**: On **iOS**, if you are loading an included file from a folder, ie: with a path something like \"Backgrounds/background1.png\", you do NOT need to include the folder as part of the path and simply supplying the file name is sufficient. On all other platforms you must supply the folder(s) as part of the path to the file.  **NOTE**: On **HTML5**, if you are loading a sprite from a secure server you may need to set the cross-origin type and use a relative path instead of an absolute path. See [ http_set_request_crossorigin](../asynchronous%20functions/http_set_request_crossorigin.html) for more details.  **NOTE**: If you are loading the sprite from a URL, then loading will be done **asynchronously** and trigger an asynchronous [Image Loaded](../../../2_interface/1_editors/events/async_events.html) event.",

            "documentation": "This function works in almost the exact same manner as [sprite_add](sprite_add.html), only instead of returning the index of the sprite you are importing, it overwrites a previously created sprite index. When using this function you should use a sprite index that has been created and stored in a variable using other functions like [sprite_add](sprite_add.html) or [sprite_create_from_surface](sprite_create_from_surface.html), or even [sprite_duplicate](sprite_duplicate.html), rather than a resource tree sprite asset. You *can* replace a sprite from the game assets using this function, but doing so means that you will lose the reference ID for the sprite that you are replacing, regardless of whether you call game_restart() or not, and so is not recommended. Regardless of the sprite being replaced, this function will **create a new texture page for the sprite** and so care should be taken when using it as it may adversely affect performance by increasing the number of required texture swaps for rendering.  The image file to be loaded should **always** be in *.png format and all images that are to be turned into animated sprites should have a \"strip\" format (see the image below). They will be split into the number of sub-images specified following the rule **sprite width = strip width / sub images**.   As you can see in the above image, the sprite has been placed on a dark purple background, and this can be removed by setting the \"removeback\" argument to true. This works by checking the *bottom left* pixel of the sprite for the colour there and then uses that as the colour to be removed. For example, in the above image, if we had the bottom left pixel colour as green, all the green parts of the sprite would have been removed and the rest of the purple background ignored.  If you choose the \"removeback\" option, you may also want *GameMaker Studio 2* to smooth the edges of the sprite by setting the \"smooth\" argument to true. All this does is create a semi-transparent border around the edges of the sprite after it has had its background removed.  Finally you can also specify the x and y *origin* for the sprite. This is the point where the sprite is \"fixed\" onto the instance that uses it, and is always calculated as relative to the 0,0 top left corner of one sprite sub-image. So, for example, a sprite that is 32 x 32 pixels with these values set to (16,16) will have its origin in the center.  By default all new sprites have their bounding boxes calculated automatically (the exact bbox will depend on the size and transparency of the sprite), however you may wish to customise this, in which case you should also use the function [sprite_collision_mask](sprite_collision_mask.html).  **NOTE**: Depending on the target platform that is chosen you are limited as to where you can save and load files from. See [File Handling](../file%20handling/index.html) for more information.     **NOTE**: You should be aware that if you are using this function in your HTML5 target game to load resources from an external server, then, due to XSS protection in browsers, attempts to load resources from across domains can be blocked and may appear to return blank results.",

Once the joining game has received the \"correlation id\" back from the server they can then call this function passing the correlation ID as the session handle argument.  The function will return -1 if there has been an error (in which case there should be console output detailing the issue), or a Request ID value otherwise.

This function can be used to get the pad that is assigned to any given slot, and is particularly useful should a user leave a gamepad without input for a certain length of time as it will switch itself off, so you can check any given User ID using this function to make sure that they have an active gamepad, and if they do not then react accordingly by (for example) pausing your game. If the pad its active, it's index value will be returned, but if not then the function will return -1.  Note that if a pad in any slot becomes inactive, later slots will \"slide\" into the vacant position, so if you have three active pads assigned to slots 0, 1 and 2, and the pad in slot 0 is inactive, slots 1 and to will now become slots 0 and 1, so slot 0 should always contain an active pad unless all pads are switched off (in which case it will return -1).  **IMPORTANT!** This function is only valid when exporting using the UWP target for the Xbox One and it requires you to have checked the **Enable XBox Live** option in the [ UWP Game Options](../../../2_interface/3_settings/game_options/options_windowsuwp.html).",

The following image illustrates this:   If you only have *one* view port setting the x or y value of the port can have some interesting effects but is not normally practical (see the image below) and so it is better to maintain the x and y position as (0,0).",

You would normally not need to use this variable as you should be setting instances to be added to discreet [layers](layer.html), which in turn are set to a specific depth, but it may be that you want to change the depth of an instance using this value, in which case a \"temporary layer\" will be created specifically for the instance at the given depth. Note that when no instances are on the same depth then this temporary layer will be removed from memory (unlike regular layers which will remain even if they have nothing on them).  **IMPORTANT!** When you modify the depth variable and GameMaker STudio 2 manages the layers, the built in [layer](layer.html) variable will return -1 and not the layer ID, since managed layers cannot be manipulated through code.   In *GameMaker Studio 2* the lower the depth value for an instance, the \"closer to the camera\" that instance will be drawn, while a higher depth value means that the instance will be drawn \"further away from the camera\", i.e: -1000 is drawn on top of -100, which is drawn on top of 0, which is drawn on top of 100, which is drawn on top of 1000.   Note that instances of an object that have the **same** depth can be drawn **above ** even when they appear to be placed one on top of the other in the room editor. If you want to guarantee that something is drawn over or under everything else, you should always set the depth (or layer) explicitly.  **NOTE:** You **cannot** set the depth of an instance in its draw event (all other events are fine).",

If you gave a named layer when the instance was created, then the new layer will also be named the same as original layer, while if you assigned a depth to the instance then the new layer will be named \"_layer_XXX\", where \"XXX\" is a hex value used to give the layer a unique name. These layers will be removed from the room on Room End. Another thing to note about layers and persistent instances is that if you have assigned the instance a named layer on creation, and there is another layer in the following rooms with the same name, then the persisted instance will be assigned to the layer with the same name *regardless of the depth of the layer*. Finally, if a persisted instance moves to a room with a layer at the same depth as the instance was created on, it will *not* be assigned to this layer, but instead a new layer will be created at the same depth (following the naming convention explained previously).  A persistent object will still have its **Game Start**, **Game End**, **Room Start** and **Room End** events triggered, however if you restart the game (with, for example, the game_restart() function) all persistent objects will be removed and only exist when created again by the game.
